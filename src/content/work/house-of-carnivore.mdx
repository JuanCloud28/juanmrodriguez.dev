## Overview
**House of Carnivore** required a digital presence that went beyond a standard website. Unlike an e-commerce store, the goal was to build a comprehensive **Brand Identity Platform**. The site serves as a digital headquarters that showcases the company's growth, detailed catalog, and value propositions across different sectors.

## Challenge
The primary complexity of this project lay in the specific demographic requirements of the business in Adelaide. A significant portion of their clientele are native Mandarin speakers. The website needed to bridge the language gap while maintaining a premium, consistent layout.

## Constraints
- **Bilingual Requirement**: Full content mirroring in English and Mandarin.
- **Visual Consistency**: Design must hold up across different character sets and text lengths.
- **Performance**: High-resolution imagery with zero lag.

## Solution
We utilised **Astro** for its content-focused performance, integrated with **React** islands to handle the interactive elements of the language switcher and catalog filtering.

1.  **Localization:** Implemented a custom routing solution to handle language persistence across browsing sessions.
2.  **Catalog Structure:** Designed a flexible content model that allows the client to display product details and specifications clearly, catering to both wholesale and retail inquiries without transactional functionality.
3.  **Performance:** Achieved high Lighthouse scores to ensure the heavy imagery of the catalog loads instantly for users on mobile networks.

## Highlights
- Hybrid rendering approach using Astro + React.
- Custom i18n routing solution.

## Results
- Established a strong digital brand for a premium meat supplier.
- Accessible to the target bilingual market without compromise.

## Next improvements
- Implement a headless CMS for easier client content updates.
- Add product filtering based on cut types and cooking methods.
