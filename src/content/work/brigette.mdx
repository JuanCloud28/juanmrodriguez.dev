## Overview
Brigette Real Estate needed to break away from the generic, template-based websites provided by their CRM (**AgentBox**), which lacked brand identity. They wanted a bespoke digital presence but were limited by how data was exported.

## Challenge
We received about 10 massive bulk files daily via FTP. The engineering challenge wasn't just parsing XML; it was **Data Integrity**. Records had to be processed in strict chronological order to correctly distinguish between new listings and updates to existing ones, ensuring no stale data overwrote the latest information.

## Constraints
- **Legacy Feed**: Data provided only via bulk XML dumps (REAXML).
- **Timing**: Updates had to be processed within minutes of receipt.
- **Budget**: Solution needed to be serverless or low-cost maintenance.

## Solution
I architected a robust backend solution on **AWS (Linux)** to bridge the gap between their CRM and their custom brand:

1.  **Chronological Stream Processing:** A custom Python script ingests the daily XML dumps, sorting them by timestamp to strictly respect the sequence of events.
2.  **Smart Upsert Logic:** The system evaluates every record—inserting new listings or carefully updating specific fields in existing ones only when valid changes occur.
3.  **Brand Independence:** By centralizing this data in our own SQL database, we detached the frontend from the CRM's limitations, allowing for a fully custom, high-end user interface.

## Highlights
- Decoupled frontend from legacy CRM constraints.
- Robust error handling for malformed XML feeds.

## Results
- Enabled the agency to own their brand identity.
- Reliable data bridge processing thousands of records daily.

## Next improvements
- Migration to a serverless architecture (AWS Lambda) for better scalability.
- Implementation of real-time webhooks if the CRM supports them in future.
