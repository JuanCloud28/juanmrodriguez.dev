## Overview
Brigette Real Estate required a bespoke digital presence distinct from the generic templates provided by their CRM, **AgentBox**. The primary goal was to establish a unique brand identity while navigating significant technical limitations in data export capabilities.

## Challenge
The project involved processing large bulk files received daily via FTP. Beyond simple XML parsing, the core engineering challenge was maintaining strict **Data Integrity**. Records required processing in precise chronological order to accurately distinguish between new listings and updates, ensuring that stale data never overwrote the latest information.

## Constraints
We worked with a **Legacy Feed** provided solely via bulk REAXML dumps. Updates needed to be processed within minutes of receipt, all while adhering to a budget that demanded a low-maintenance, cost-effective infrastructure.

## Solution
I architected a robust backend solution on **AWS (Linux)** to bridge the gap between their CRM and custom frontend.

The system uses a custom Python script to ingest and sort daily XML dumps by timestamp, strictly respecting the **Chronological Stream Processing**. Through **Smart Upsert Logic**, it evaluates every record to insert new listings or update specific fields only when valid changes occur. By centralizing this data in our own SQL database, we successfully decoupled the frontend from the CRM's limitations, enabling a fully custom, **Brand Independent** interface.

## Highlights
- Decoupled frontend from legacy CRM constraints
- Robust error handling for malformed XML feeds

## Results
- Enabled the agency to fully own their brand identity
- Reliable data bridge processing thousands of records daily

## Next improvements
- Migration to a serverless architecture (AWS Lambda) for better scalability
- Implementation of real-time webhooks pending CRM support
